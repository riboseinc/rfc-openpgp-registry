= Implementation Features Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "Features"

* Mark value "First Octet, 0x80" as "Private Use" in the registry.

* Rename the column "Value" to "Flag"

* Change registry policy to **Specification Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register an item
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

Add the following note:

----
This is a variable-length bit field.

Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
**SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way.
