= Security Considerations

The change to *Specification Required* from *IETF Review* lowers
the barrier to add functionality and cryptographic algorithms for
OpenPGP. 

For registries that involve cryptographic algorithms, this change
reflects the practical reality in that the "openpgp" mailing list is
not responsible for cryptographic reviews, which is especially
difficult for national cipher suites.

Security Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use
at the time of registration. However, since cryptographic algorithms and
parameters will be broken or weakened over time, it *MAY* be
possible that the recommended status in the registry lags behind the
most recent advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users
*SHOULD* check that the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to
provide the expected level of security desired.
