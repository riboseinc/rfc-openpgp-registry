= Security Considerations

The change to **Specification Required** from **IETF Review** lowers the
barrier to add functionality and cryptographic algorithms for OpenPGP. 

For the cryptographic algorithm registries, this change reflects reality in
that the WG essentially provided no cryptographic review of the cipher suites
or supported groups, which is especially true of national cipher suites.

Recommended algorithms regarded as secure for general use at the time
of registration, however, cryptographic algorithms and parameters
will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that the
recommended status in the registry lags behind the most recent
advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
level of security.
