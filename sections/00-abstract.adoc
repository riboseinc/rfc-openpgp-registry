[abstract]

This document describes a number of changes to the OpenPGP (RFC 4880)
IANA registries that range from adding notes to the registry 
to changing registration policies.  These changes were motivated
by recently proposed extensions to OpenPGP.
Existing IANA OpenPGP registry policies are defined by RFC 4880.
