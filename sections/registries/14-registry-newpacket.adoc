= New Packet Versions Registry

This registry is currently empty.

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Packet Type Versions"

* It should have the following columns: "Packet Type", "Version",
"Security Recommended", "Interoperability Recommended", "Reference"

* Change registry policy to **RFC Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* Add the following note:
+
----
Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
**SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way.
----

* A Standards Track document is required to register a Packet Type
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.
