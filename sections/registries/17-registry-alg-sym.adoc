[#registry-alg-sym]
= Symmetric Key Algorithms Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename registry to "OpenPGP Symmetric Key Algorithms".

* Algorithm descriptions have been simplified and applicable
  references moved to the "Reference" column.

* All algorithm descriptions with "[n+] bit" is updated to "[n+]-bit"
  for consistency, for example, the phrase "128 bit key" becomes
  "128-bit key".

* Change registry policy to **Specification Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register an item
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

* Existing registrations with a "Reference" value pointing to a
non-IETF published document should be checked to see if an
IETF-published document is available, and if so, update the reference
to point to the IETF-published document instead for consistency.

Add the following note:

----
Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
**SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way. References to IETF-published documents are
preferred. The "Reference" value should point to a document that
details the implementation of this algorithm in OpenPGP, not of
the algorithm itself.
