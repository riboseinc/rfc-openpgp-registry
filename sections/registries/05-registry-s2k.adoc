[#registry-s2k]
= PGP String-to-Key (S2K) Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "OpenPGP String-to-Key (S2K) Algorithms"

* Change registry policy to **Specification Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register an S2K algorithm
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

Add the following note:

----
Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented
in an interoperable way, with notable benefits for the wider
OpenPGP community.
