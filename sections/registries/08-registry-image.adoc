[#registry-image]
= Image Format Subpacket Types Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Image Format Subpacket Types"

* Rename the column "Attribute" to "Image Format Type"

* Change registry policy to *Specification Required*.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register a Packet Type/Tag
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

Add the following note:

----
Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
*SHOULD* provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way.
