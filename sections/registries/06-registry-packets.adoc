[#registry-packets]
= PGP Packet Types/Tags Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Packet Types"

* Rename the column "Attribute" to "Packet Type"

* Change registry policy to *RFC Required*.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register a Packet Type
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

Add the following note:

----
Note: Due to the scarcity of codepoints in this registry,
experts are to verify that the proposed registration
*MUST* provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way.
