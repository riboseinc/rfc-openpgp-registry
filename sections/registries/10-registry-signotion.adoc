= Signature Notation Data Subpacket Notation Types Registry

This registry is currently empty.

However, the existing IANA registry contains an erroneous note
that the registry is about "User Notations". According to <<RFC4880>>
which defined this registry, "[n]otations contain a user space that is
completely unmanaged". This registry should be for the <<RFC4880>>
"IETF (name)space".

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Rename the registry to "OpenPGP Notation Data Subpacket Notation Types".

* Change registry policy to **Specification Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

Update its erroneous "Note" that says:

----
Notation names are arbitrary strings encoded in UTF-8. They reside two
name spaces: The IETF name space and the user name space.

The IETF name space is registered with IANA. These names MUST NOT
contain the "@" character (0x40).  This is a tag for the user name
space.
----

To:

----
Notation names are arbitrary strings encoded in UTF-8, and there are
two namespaces:

* IETF namespace: keys are of any string but **MUST NOT** contain the
"@" character (0x40). Allowed keys **MUST** by registered in this
registry.

* User namespace: keys are of form "[name]@[domain]", these are
unmanaged keys and NOT maintained by this registry.

Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
is necessary and **SHOULD** provide general benefits for the wider
OpenPGP community.
