= Compression Algorithms Registry

Proposed changes to the registry:

* Change registry policy to **Specification Required**.

* Update its "Reference" to also refer to this document.

* A Standards Track document is required to register an item
with the value "Yes" in any recommendation.

* Existing registrations with a "Reference" value pointing to a
non-IETF published document should be checked to see if an
IETF-published document is available, and if so, update the reference
to point to the IETF-published document instead for consistency.

Add the following note:

----
Note: Experts are to verify that the proposed registration
**SHOULD** provide notable benefits for the wider OpenPGP community,
and provides a publicly-available standard that can be implemented in
an interoperable way. References to IETF-published documents are
preferred.

Update the following registrations:
